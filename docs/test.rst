TESTS
=====

This library has tests to help us with possible errors.
It has also made github actions for more detailed checking.

How to use them
-----

At first we have to enter the folder with ``mmpackage``.
To do it, open ``cmd``.

.. code-block:: console

  $ C:\Users\User> cd mmpackage
  
  $ C:\Users\User\mmpackage>

Then we need to run ``test.py`` which is in the "tests" folder.

.. code-block:: console

  $ python tests/test.py
  
And that's it! If there are any errors, you will be informed about them and the place where they occurred.
